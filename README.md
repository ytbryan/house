# This is the first collaborative "project" done by the TP SGUS Cloud Support & DevOps students of the 1st Cohort.

# The main goal is to learn and to understand the basic functions of Git and the usage of Github by making changes to the original git repo, commit to the changes and pushing it into the remote Github server.

# The theme of this project is 'house'. Thus, please make changes in accordance to the theme.

# This introductory/experimental "project" is initiated by our instructor Bryan Lim (ytbryan).

# Perhaps it could be of good use, in some ways, for the next cohorts to come.
